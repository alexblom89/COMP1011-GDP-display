# COMP1011 Advanced OOP using Java, Assignment 1

The purpose of this assignment is to build a Graphical User Interface that allows users to read information from a MySQL database and display it as chart data.

The application has one view for a table and one for a chart, that displays the GDP of countries. A CSV file utility class reads a .csv file containing GDP data and converts it into an SQL file, which is then read into the MySQL database.
